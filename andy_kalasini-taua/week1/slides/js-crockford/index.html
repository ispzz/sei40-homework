         Javascript is a language with more than its share of bad parts. It went from non-existence to global adoption in an alarmingly short period of time. It never had an interval in the lab when it could be tried out and polished. It went straight into Netscape Navigator 2 just as it was, and it was very rough. When Java applets failed, Javascript became the “Language of the Web” by default. <span class="fragment highlight-green">Javascript’s popularity is almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language.</span>

					 Fortunately, Javascript has some extraordinarily good parts. In JavaScript, there is a beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language that is <span class="fragment highlight-green">buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders.</span> The best nature of Javascript is so effectively hidden that for many years the prevailing opinion of Javascript was that it was an unsightly, incompetent toy.

The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or even knowing much about programming. It is a language with enormous expressive power.

There are those who will say <em>terrible</em> things about the JavaScript language.  <span class="fragment highlight-green">Many of these things are true.</span> When I was required to write something in JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to despise it. It would accept almost anything I typed but interpret it in a way that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue here: <span class="fragment highlight-green">JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you.</span>

The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions. It got almost everything right.  <span class="fragment">But, as you should expect with Javascript, it didn’t get everything right.</span>

<section>
	 <blockquote  class="justify">
JavaScript is much maligned for its choice of key ideas. For the most part, though, those choices were good, if unusual. But there was one choice that was particularly bad: Javascript depends on global variables for linkage. All of the top-level variables of all compilation units are tossed together in a common namespace called the global object. <span class="fragment highlight-green">This is a bad thing because global variables are evil, and in Javascript they are fundamental.</span> Fortunately, as we will see, Javascript also gives us the tools to mitigate this problem.

 Deep down, Javascript has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java. It is Lisp in C’s clothing. This makes Javascript a remarkably powerful language.
