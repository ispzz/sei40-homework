  Homework: The Word Guesser
  --------------------------
  You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
*/

// - Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '\_', '\_', '\_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
const secretWord = ['O', 'F', 'O'];
const guessedLetters = [];

// - Write a function called guessLetter that will:
// - Take one argument, the guessed letter.
// - Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// - If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
// - When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
// and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// - It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
// and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
// - Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
const guessLetter = function(letter){
  letter = letter.toUpperCase(); // User can enter upper or lowercase letters

  // Compare guess with word
  for (let i = 0; i < secretWord.length; i++){
    if ((secretWord[i] === letter) && (typeof guessedLetters[i] === 'undefined')){
      guessedLetters[i] = letter;
      console.log(`You guessed a letter!`);
      break;
    }
  }

  // Tell user state of the game
  if (guessedLetters.length > 0){ // User has guessed at least 1 letter
    console.log(`Guessed letters: ${guessedLetters.join(", ")}`);
  } else{
    console.log(`No new letters matched. Have another go!`);
  }

  // Winner?
  if (secretWord.toString() === guessedLetters.toString()){
    console.log(`Congratulations! You won the game 🥳`);

    // Reset ready for a new game
    guessedLetters.length = 0;
    console.log(`Play again?`);
  }
};



// ## Bonus: Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:
// - Start with a reward amount of $0
// - Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
// - When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.

// ## Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
// - Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
// - Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
// - Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.
