## Text Soup

Using HTML, CSS and JS + jQuery, create a web page which prints a random word from a large sample of text, in a random position on the page, every 100 milliseconds.

#### Hints:
- Grab some plain text (20-50 paragraphs should do) from one the top 100 novels in the public domain at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top), and paste the text into a hidden `<div>` element in your HTML file (use CSS to hide it).
- Use jQuery to get the contents of the div as a string, then split up the string into an array of words.
- Re-use the `getRandomElementFromArray()` function we wrote at the end of week 1 to pick a random word from the array.
- Use jQuery to 1) create a new DIV with that word as its contents, 2) set the DIV to appear at a random position on the page , and 3) append it to the DOM. 


#### Bonus:
- Fade the text in to make it appear, and then fade it out to disappear, to stop the page getting too dense with texty text.
- Try random colours, random font sizes, rotation, whatever floats your boat.
